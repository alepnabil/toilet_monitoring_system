This system is a custom IoT monitoring solution built on a 2-layer PCB.

Hardware & Sensing Core
The core hardware is centered around an Arduino Nano, which serves as the main microcontroller.

Air Quality: The MQ-135 sensor continuously measures air quality, providing data crucial for cleanliness assessment.

Usage Tracking: The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor is employed to accurately count people, gathering real-time usage statistics.

Data Transmission: A 433MHz RF module enables reliable, low-power transmission of all sensor data to a centralized receiving system.
